### Update

- After using fedora for about a year now, 
I've finally been able to make it work.


### Major issues 
- Sadly currently as of posting this kernel 5.19
has an issue that somehow (I definitely do some more research on this)
That breaks the ability to run a single gpu setup without doing a reboot after the vm shutdown. 

## Where da files
- I will need to fix some minor issues I'm going on holiday and 
Will most likely post the files by Monday!

This was an awesome project to work on, definitely not perfect but it works
Well enough that I can play some nice multiplayer games smoothly.
