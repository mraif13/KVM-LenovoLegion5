### Fedora experience

---

Fedora works fine, but I do recommend settings the SELINUX Status to permissive.

Okay, you might ask but Raif why make this change? 
- From my experience playing around with its settings, it seems SELINUX (default) causes some issues that prevents kvms to work properly.
