### Info

Due to recent bug in the Linux kernel 5.19 that hasn't been fixed yet, we are now required to reboot after shutting down our the virtual machine. <br>
If you don't want to reboot your only option is to use a LTS kernel, if you do head inside of the folder called "before-5.19" it should contain the scripts needed.
